# HoneyPot-Server

Deployeed and managed a cloud-based honeypot using T-Pot on DigitalOcean to capture and analyze real world malicious activity. Utilized Windows PowerShell for secure remote management and automation, monitored attacker behavior through generated logs, and analyzed brute-force attempts, scanning activity, and exploitation techniques. Collected and reviewed attack data to support threat detection, log analysis, and SOC-style alert triage.


## what is a honeypot?
A deliberately vulnerable system set up to attract, detect, and study malicious activity, without putting real systems at risk.
